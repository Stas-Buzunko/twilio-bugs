# twilio-bugs
[Twilio](twilio.com) has poor docs and horrible support.
I had my tickets answered **after 1-1.5 months** only and if I didn't reply to them **after 2-3 days ticket was closed**.

This repo has a few purposes:

a) show how many bugs twilio has and so that other developer may decide to use some alternative instead

b) attract attention from twilio in order for them to improve their docs and support

How can you contribute?

a) report bugs that haven't been reported before (but search through other issues first)

b) give a star to this repo, let's make repo with bugs have more stars than twilio repos
